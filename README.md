Heist!

You and your friends are a group of robbers trying to break into a bank and get away with the gold inside the vault.
The problem is that, as we all know, there's no honor among thieves. The person who manages the penetrate the vault keeps the gold for themself! 

All pieces start as parts of the bank. When attached they will show the bank floor plan, revealing it's thick walls. 
Long pressing a blink will turn it to a theif piece which you use to break into the bank. 
Single clicking a theif piece will change it's color, so you can play on different teams!
triple click at any time to reset the game

To break into the bank and get the gold you slide your theif peices along the table towards the bank. 
if it succesfully connects you will see that you do damage to the wall. 
Once the wall loses all it's hit points it will show the piece of gold you get for infiltrating the vault, 
and the player who broke through gets to take that gold for themself.
whoever gets the most gold when then banks is empty is the winner!
